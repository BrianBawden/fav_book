# Book List



This program is designed to allow a user to keep track of the books they have read including:
* Title
* Author
* Pages
* Notes

## How to Guide

* book_list.csv is the file that holds all the data for the program
* books_gui1.py is when I started to work on using a gui instead of the terminal
* books_terminal.py is the original concept using just the terminal to get the logic of the code working.
* books.py is like books_gui1.py the uses the gui to interact with the program. 

## To do List

* make a file that uses a class instead of functions.
* update search button to check for any match and ignore upper or lower case
* clean up the repetition of code in the different functions.
